	<div>
		<p class="big">Some of my hobbies include reading, roller skating, video games, swimming, and boy scouts. My favorite color is red, as it is a visually appealing color to me. I am sometimes a rather quiet person, but can be expressive when I want to be. My biggest fear is the fear of the unknown, and what I dont see or hear around me that I wish to understand. </p>
